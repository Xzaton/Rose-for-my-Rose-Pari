          <br />
          I don't follow Rose Day and all but i wanted to give flower <br />to you
          and the rose day was around corner so thought of making this and more 
          actual reason are told below.

          So each petal of it symbolizes my admiration and my love for you and 
          will continue until the rose dies which means as long as the internet 
          continues to exist and for it to die is to end of the world. 
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.Like a rose in full
          bloom, your beauty captivates my heart. The red roses reflect the
          passion that burns for you, while the white ones signify the purity of
          love. In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Talking to you makes my day as sweet as the fragrance of roses.

          I am not into valentine thing or so because its a western culture and 
          to give love,flowers and all you don't need to follow valentine week or  
          anything, its anytime random whenever you can but ik passionatly  
          and romantically people do these stuffs, so in that sense too but 
          mainly because I can't give you the real flowers for now although 
          I once tried giving you your favourite flower which i remember you said 
          is Lotusü™∑ they come in many different colours but mine was pink one.
          Navratri ka week tha (Tritiya day 3, Saturday Oct 05) Toh hospital ke 
          liye nikla fir waha se jldi se apke liye lotus khridne nikla and fir 
          idhr udhr ghum fir ke dhun dhan ke lotus khridta jldi se pandal pe phuchu 
          bcs late ho raha tha socha kahi puja khtm na hojaye ya esa situation na aye 
          ki phool na de pau apko so it was ki i wanted to give Lotus to you aur 
          Apko mann kiya toh you could give it to Mata Rani too ya leke jaa skte apne sath 
          kyuki mene ye socha tha ki apko phool dena hai kuch hojaye toh jldi phuchu 
          acha rhega jise prepare rhe ke de pau and iss liye late ho raha tha 7bjne 
          wale the but late nhi hua ulta Aarti late start hui and uk what mere phone mai

          ke chkr mai extra paise lena bhul gya tha and then mai hospital se waha
          phool leke phucha 7 se 8:30 tk wait kiya aarti ka and jb 10min kuch the
          arti mai toh mene apke naam se lotus phool chadha diya Mata Rani ko 
          and pandit ji ne vo phool unke hath pe rakh diya i was really happy ki 
          chlo vese nhi toh ese hi sahi kya pta arti ke time ajao aap and socha

          vo phool mene diya hai and apke liye laya tha de nhi paya toh apke naam se 
          chadha diya but na vo hua aur naa bta paya so yaha bta raha hu sorry,
          You are the first, middle and the last person for whom 
          i will always buy flowers for. And also the ones  I have made for you,
          so I thought of making this website or to say a virtual Rose
          and a sweet small letter for The Worlds Most Beautiful, Prettiest,
          Strongest and Awesome Girl, for My Pasandida Aurat, for My Love<3 
          For Meri Pyri Pari ji. Hope you like it although its not much.
