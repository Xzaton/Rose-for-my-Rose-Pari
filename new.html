          <br />
          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.Like a rose in full
          bloom, your beauty captivates my heart. The red roses reflect the
          passion that burns for you, while the white ones signify the purity of
          love. In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Talking to you makes my day as sweet as the fragrance of roses.And now
          I am not into valentine thing or so because its a western culture and to
          give love,flowers and all you don't need to follow valentine week or  
          anything, its anytime random whenever you can but ik passionatly  
          and romantically people do these stuffs, so in that sense too but 
          mainly because I can't give you the real flowers for now and also the ones 
          I have made for you, so I thought of making this website or to say 
          a virtual Rose and a sweet small letter for The Worlds Most Beautiful, 
          Prettiest, Strongest and Awesome Girl, for My Pasandida Aurat, for My Love<3, 
          For Meri Pyri Pari ji. Hope you like it although its not much.
